# Game description
 The connect 4 game is the popular kids game. I created this Connect 4 game in python.

 This game is straight forward:
    - I draw the board, and allow to players to take turns placing their pieces on the board. The first player to get 4 crosses of diagonal should win!

    - Normally pieces would be red and black, but on this case, one player will label as "X" and the other one lebel as "O"
